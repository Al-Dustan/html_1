					<strong>Tanjiro Kamado</strong> <em>is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He became his family's breadwinner after his father's death, traveling to the nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything changed when he came home one day to discover his family was attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko were the sole survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyū and sent to his retired master Sakonji Urokodaki for training to also become a Demon Slayer, beginning his quest to help his sister turn into a human again and avenge the death of his family.

After two years of strenuous training during which he learns the "Water Breathing" style, Tanjiro takes part in a formidable exam and is one of the few survivors to pass, officially making him a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. He begins his work of hunting down and slaying demons alongside Nezuko, who has been hypnotized to bring no harm to humans and who occasionally helps him in battle. One of Tanjiro's assignments brings him to Asakusa where he encounters Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one who murdered his family. He also meets Tamayo and Yushiro, two demons who are free from Muzan's control. Tamayo and Yushiro ally with Tanjiro and begin to develop a cure for Nezuko, though it will require Tanjiro to supply Tamayo with blood from the Twelve Kizuki, the most powerful demons under Muzan's command.

Continuing his missions, Tanjiro meets Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira, fellow survivors of the exam with whom he forms an unlikely team during a battle with the former Lower Rank Six of the Kizuki. The group soon faces off against Lower Rank Five of the Kizuki, and although Tanjiro unlocks a mysterious style called "Hinokami Kagura", they are ultimately outmatched. They are rescued by Giyū and Insect Hashira Shinobu Kocho and brought back to headquarters. At headquarters, the Kamado siblings partake in a council between Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps, and the Hashira, the Corps' most elite members, who, with the exception of Giyū, do not believe Nezuko should be allowed to live. However, Kagaya nonetheless manages to convince them to accept her. With this agreement, Tanjiro begins to work alongside the Hashira, where he encounters significantly more resistance from the demons. Alongside the Hashira and Corps members, Tanjiro takes part in numerous harrowing battles against the Kizuki, which they survive by narrow margins while also taking losses of their own, including the death of Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku and retirement of Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui. During a battle in the Swordsmith Village, Tanjiro meets Genya Shinazugawa, the younger brother of Wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa, who has the mysterious ability to temporarily become a demon by eating demon flesh. It is also discovered Nezuko is invulnerable to sunlight, making her the prime target of Muzan, who has long sought a way to overcome the sun and thus become the ultimate being. Tanjiro also learns his Hinokami Kagura is descended from Sun Breathing, the original breathing style invented by Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the strongest Demon Slayer in history, and develops it to prepare to fight Muzan.

Kagaya forecasts Muzan's intentions and enacts a strict training regimen of the entire Corps to prepare for the upcoming battle. With the blood samples obtained from the Kizuki, Tamayo develops a serum to cure Nezuko, who is kept isolated far from the battle as she recovers. Soon, Muzan appears before Kagaya, who triggers a suicide attack to stagger him. The Hashira and Tanjiro ambush Muzan, but he traps them all within Infinity Castle, an endless labyrinth which houses the remaining Kizuki. Tamayo restrains Muzan with a poison she concocted, leaving him vulnerable to attack. To reach him, the Corps defeat the remaining Kizuki members, though Shinobu, Genya, and Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito are killed. Muzan kills Tamayo by crushing and absorbing her, but is forced above ground by the Corps. A desperate battle of attrition ensues as the remainder of the Demon Slayer Corps fight against Muzan until the morning sun can kill him. Aided by Tamayo's poison, the Corps succeed, though they take huge losses, including Stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima, Serpent Hashira Obanai Iguro, and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji, with Giyu, Tengen, and Sanemi as the only Hashira survivors, while Tanjiro is mortally wounded while delivering the final blow. Helpless against the sun, Muzan forcefully gives his remaining blood to a dying Tanjiro and transforms him into the ultimate demon in a last-ditch effort to have his species survive. Tanjiro begins to attack the remaining Corps members, but through the efforts of his allies and Nezuko, who has been fully restored to her human self, he is turned back into a human.

In the aftermath of the battle, the Corps is disbanded after the death of Muzan has effectively vanquished all other demons. Yushiro goes to live a peaceful life as a painter. Tanjiro and Nezuko return to their family home, accompanied by Zenitsu and Inosuke. Tanjiro and Inosuke marry fellow Demon Slayers Kanao Tsuyuri and Aoi Kanzaki, respectively, while Nezuko marries Zenitsu.

In a modern-day epilogue, the descendants and reincarnations of the Corps members enjoy a peaceful life free of demons.

				<em>Manhwa (Korean: 만화; Hanja: 漫畵; Korean pronunciation: [manhwa]) is the general Korean term for comics and print cartoons. Outside Korea, the term usually refers to South Korean comics.[1] Manhwa is greatly influenced by Japanese Manga comics. Modern Manhwa has extended its reach to many other countries. These comics have branched outside of Korea by access of Webtoons and have created an impact that has resulted in many movie and television show adaptations.

				<em>The term "Webtoon" (웹툰) is a portmanteau of the Korean words 웹 meaning web and 카툰 meaning cartoon. The term was first coined on 8 August 2000, by Chollian, one of South Korea's oldest and now discontinued internet service engines.[18] Webtoons are the digital form of manhwa that first came into popularity in the early 2000s due to their free access and availability on the internet.[19] It was also beneficial to creators because it helped them get around strict South Korean censorship laws.[20] Webtoons encourage amateur writers to publish their own stories for others to read.[18] Since their creation, webtoons have gained popularity around the globe and have even been adopted outside of Korea as another form of comic publication.[21] This is credited to their unique format and pay model.

In 2014 WEBTOON's global website and mobile app were launched, revolutionizing the comic world's way of reading for entertainment. Also, around this time JunKoo Kim, the person that started LINE Webtoon, had reported that Webtoon was used in 60 countries, had 55 million monthly users, and 100 billion annual views
